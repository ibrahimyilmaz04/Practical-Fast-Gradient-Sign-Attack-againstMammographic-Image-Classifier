# On the Assessment of Robustness of Telemedicine Applications against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks

In this paper, we aim to show ifthere  are  adversarial  attacks  that  can  foolmammographic image classifiers. Based on our study, it is found that mammo-graphic image classifiers might misclassify the input images if they are poisonedby adversarial attacks. As a result, the robustness of the breast cancer classifiermodel will be impacted. We address issue by showing different case studies andanalyze  a  potential  solution  for  this  problem.  This  paper  contains  the  follow-ing constructive contributions to highlight this security weakness and heightenawareness of physicians when giving a diagnosis of cancer.

- We highlight and assess the security vulnerability of CNN, which are widelyused in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
- We implement an efficient adversarial attack on mammographic images inorder to fool the mammographic image classifier.
- We analyze the comparison between original and crafted mamograpgic im-ages using structural similarity index (SSIM) and investigate how originalimage changes based on different perturbation coefficient.
